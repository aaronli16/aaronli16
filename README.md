<h1>Hey, I'm Aaron! </h1>
  <h3>Double major in Informatics and Statistics at the University of Washington </h3>
 

  I'm passionate about creating products that help people form meaningful experiences and memories. Whether it's through AI-powered tools, music tech, or
  community platforms, I'm driven to build things that matter.

  Currently working on **Jubai** — an AI email automation platform for ecommerce brands. Always exploring new ideas in music tech, sustainability, and full-stack development.

  ###  SimSample - Audio Similarity Search
  As a fellow beginner music producer with no music theory background, I got lazy doom scrolling through splice for my desired sound. I constantly hear sounds when I listen to
  my favorite artists and I wish I can find something similar. That is why I built an **audio processing system** that lets music producers upload sample libraries and find
  similar sounds instantly using **audio fingerprinting** and **similarity search**.

  **Features:**
  - **Chunked Processing:** Handles 500MB+ sample libraries through distributed batch processing
  - **Audio Fingerprinting:** Extracts MFCC features using librosa for similarity comparison
  - **FAISS Search:** Fast similarity search across thousands of audio samples
  - **Cloud Deployment:** Production-ready deployment on Google Cloud Run with memory optimization

  **Tech Stack:**
  - **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
  - **Backend:** Flask, librosa, FAISS
  - **Cloud:** Google Cloud Run
  - **Audio:** MFCC feature extraction, similarity algorithms

  **[Live Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU8TpB0VaZ8)**

  ## What I Learned
  - Solved cloud memory constraints through chunked processing architecture
  - Implemented audio fingerprinting and similarity search algorithms
  - Deployed production systems handling large file uploads (500MB+)
  - Learned to balance technical performance with user experience under resource constraints

  ### LostAF - Maze Generation & Pathfinding
  A project exploring **graph algorithms and disjoint sets** to generate **random, solvable mazes** and compute **the shortest path solutions**.

  **Features:**
  - **Randomized Maze Generation:** Uses **disjoint sets** to ensure all mazes are solvable.
  - **Shortest Path Calculation:** Implements **Dijkstra's Algorithm** to find optimal paths.
  - **Minimal Spanning Tree:** Utilizes **Kruskal's Algorithm** for efficient maze structure generation.
  - **Custom Disjoint Set Implementation:** Designed and optimized a **union-find** data structure.

  **Tech Stack:**
  - **Languages:** Java
  - **Algorithms:** Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Union-Find (Disjoint Sets)

  🔗 **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aaronli16/LostAF)**

  ## What I Learned

  - How to implement core graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Kruskal's from scratch
  - Built my own Union-Find (disjoint set) data structure and understood its use in connectivity
  - Learned to structure Java code across multiple classes and test edge cases
  - Gained confidence in turning theoretical CS concepts into something visual and interactive

  ### FireTrack
  A **community-driven fire tracking platform** that allows users to **report wildfires**, **share critical information**, and **organize/promote fundraisers/events** for
  disaster relief.

  **Features:**
  - **Real-time Fire Reports:** Users can report and verify wildfires in their area.
  - **Interactive Map:** Built with **Leaflet API** and **Nominatim** for precise fire location mapping.
  - **Community Hub:** A space to share blogs, safety tips, and fundraising events for fire-affected areas.
  - **Alerts & Notifications:** Stay informed with up-to-date fire warnings and safety information.

  **Tech Stack:**
