### 🏗 LostAF - Maze Generation & Pathfinding
A project exploring **graph algorithms and disjoint sets** to generate **random, solvable mazes** and compute **the shortest path solutions**.

🚀 **Features:**
- **Randomized Maze Generation:** Uses **disjoint sets** to ensure all mazes are solvable.
- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Implements **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to find optimal paths.
- **Minimal Spanning Tree:** Utilizes **Kruskal’s Algorithm** for efficient maze structure generation.
- **Custom Disjoint Set Implementation:** Designed and optimized a **union-find** data structure.

🛠 **Tech Stack:**
- **Languages:**  Java 
- **Algorithms:** Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Union-Find (Disjoint Sets)

🔗 **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aaronli16/LostAF)**

## What I Learned

- How to implement core graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Kruskal's from scratch
- Built my own Union-Find (disjoint set) data structure and understood its use in connectivity
- Learned to structure Java code across multiple classes and test edge cases
- Gained confidence in turning theoretical CS concepts into something visual and interactive

### 🔥 FireTrack
A **community-driven fire tracking platform** that allows users to **report wildfires**, **share critical information**, and **organize/promote fundraisers/events** for disaster relief.

🚀 **Features:**
- **Real-time Fire Reports:** Users can report and verify wildfires in their area.
- **Interactive Map:** Built with **Leaflet API** and **Nominatim** for precise fire location mapping.
- **Community Hub:** A space to share blogs, safety tips, and fundraising events for fire-affected areas.
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Stay informed with up-to-date fire warnings and safety information.

🛠 **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Firebase (Authentication, Realtime Database)
- **Mapping:** Leaflet API & Nominatim
- **Hosting:** Firebase Hosting

🔗 **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aaronli16/FireTrack)** 

**Live Demo:** [firetrack-80309.web.app](https://firetrack-80309.web.app)

## What I Learned

- How to build and deploy a full-stack app using React and Firebase
- Integrated third-party APIs like Leaflet and Nominatim to build interactive maps
- Learned to manage real-time user input and authentication using Firebase services
- Saw how community-focused apps need intuitive UI and clear information flow
- Practiced scoping MVP features and making design trade-offs

### 🧠 InSight - AI-Powered Image Descriptor
An **AI-powered accessibility tool** designed to generate **customizable image descriptions** for users with visual impairments. Built with a Colab-hosted backend using Detectron2 + Claude API, and a responsive Next.js frontend.

🚀 **Features:**
- Upload an image and receive a natural language description powered by computer vision + AI
- Customizable outputs based on vision needs (e.g. color blindness, short vs detailed descriptions)
- Backend hosted on **Google Colab** with a live tunnel to local frontend via **ngrok**

🛠 **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Flask (Colab), Detectron2, Claude API
- **Tools:** ngrok, Pandas, Web scraping
- **Data:** VizWiz Dataset

🔗 **[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/aaronli16/InSight)**

## What I Learned

- How to connect a Colab-hosted backend with a local frontend using ngrok
- Basics of working with Detectron2 and object detection pipelines
- Handling API requests between Flask and React
- Navigating challenges with system compatibility and debugging Python packages

### 🎵 SimSample - Audio Similarity Search
As a fellow beginner music producer with no music theory background, I got lazy doom scrolling through splice for my desired sound. I constantly hear sounds when I listen to my favorite artists and I wish I can find something similar. That is why I built an ** audio processing system** that lets music producers upload sample libraries and find similar sounds instantly using **audio fingerprinting** and **similarity search**. 

🚀 **Features:**
- **Chunked Processing:** Handles 500MB+ sample libraries through distributed batch processing
- **Audio Fingerprinting:** Extracts MFCC features using librosa for similarity comparison
- **FAISS Search:** Fast similarity search across thousands of audio samples
- **Cloud Deployment:** Production-ready deployment on Google Cloud Run with memory optimization

🛠 **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Flask, librosa, FAISS
- **Cloud:** Google Cloud Run
- **Audio:** MFCC feature extraction, similarity algorithms

🔗 **[Live Demo](https://simsample-371783151021.us-central1.run.app)**

**[Live Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU8TpB0VaZ8)**


## What I Learned
- Solved cloud memory constraints through chunked processing architecture
- Implemented audio fingerprinting and similarity search algorithms
- Deployed production systems handling large file uploads (500MB+)
- Learned to balance technical performance with user experience under resource constraints
